# Game2D 2019

**The Converters ** is a 2D game I did during a week for my Gamedev Course at Universitat Pompeu Fabra.


Its a turn based game, the image is 128x128 pixels.

The whole game is coded in c++ using a simple 2D framework.

The game logic is less than 1000 lines of code.

All the graphics are stored in a single image.

This is publishes as an educational example.
